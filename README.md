dopepod is a web app capable of playing and searching a wide variety of free podcasts. Registered users can also subscribe to podcasts and create a playlist of episodes. It uses the Python web-framework Django as a backend. The podcasts are scraped from the web using Scrapy and requests. Frontend framework Bootstrap is used for CSS. Javascript libraries JQuery, Slick, and vanilla-lazyload are also used.
